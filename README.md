# ⚛️ React + TypeScript Learning Project

## 🧠 Project Explanation

This project is a **React + TypeScript web application** built using modern tools like **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **PostCSS**.  
It was created using **Bolt** and **Vibe Code**, mainly for **learning and exploring how React projects work** — not as a commercial product.

The goal of this project is to **understand the structure, setup, and behavior** of a full front-end React app — including how routing, components, and authentication context are handled in a modern setup.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🧩 React + TypeScript
The app is built using React components written in TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.

### ⚡ Vite as the Build Tool
Vite provides fast local development and optimized builds for production.

### 🎨 Tailwind CSS
All the styling is done using Tailwind, making the UI clean, responsive, and easy to customize.

### 🔐 Authentication Context (`AuthContext.tsx`)
The app manages user login and registration states using React’s Context API, giving a smooth login/logout experience.

### 📂 Multiple Pages
Pages like **Home**, **Dashboard**, **Login**, **Register**, and **Quiz** are organized under the `/src/pages` folder — each handling a specific part of the user flow.

### 🎯 Learning Focus
This project was made to practice:
- Setting up a **React + TypeScript** environment  
- Understanding how **Vite** works as a development server  
- Learning **Tailwind CSS integration**  
- Managing state with **React Context**  
- Exploring **basic page navigation** and **component design**
